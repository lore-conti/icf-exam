# ICF Exam Preparation Quiz App

A simple web-based quiz application using Python and Flask to help preparation for ICF Exam. This app displays multiple-choice questions, provides feedback, and shows the final score.

## Features

- Shows feedback after each question, including correct and incorrect answers
- Tracks and displays the total and correct answers
- Shows a final score and an option to restart the quiz

## Questions source
The questions are constructed using the following sources of information:
- Introducing the ICF ACC Credential Exam
- Sample ACC Exam Questions
- ICF Code of Ethics 
- ICF Core Competencies
- ICF Core Competencies Markers
- ICF ETHICS FAQs 
- ICF CORE VALUES

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask

### Installation
Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username/your-repositor>y.git`

Install the required Python packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Virtual Environment 
### Create Virtual Environment
`python -m venv venv`
### Activate Virtual Environment
`venv/bin/activate`
`.\venv\Scripts\activate`
### Deactivate Virtual Environment
`deactivate`

## Configuration
Persistent Secret Key:
* For production deployments, itâ€™s crucial to have a persistent secret key to avoid invalidating user sessions when the application restarts.
* Set SECRET_KEY in the environment to ensure stability.
Fallback (Development):
* Generating a random key with os.urandom is useful for local development and testing environments but is not recommended for production.

Always use a fixed, secure secret key in production, stored in a safe place like environment variables or a secret management tool.


## Create the db for production
```python
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```
